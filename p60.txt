To the reverend and learned minister Jacobus Heijblock.

Here Rembrandt shows us how old Simeon
Takes with joy his savior and Messiah in his arms;
And wishes now to die, because the sun of his grace
Has appeared, who protects all people
(trusting staunchly in him) against hell and eternal death:
This teaches that the pious are not at all afraid to die,
For death holds dread for evil ones, but is a helper in need for the good;
What then, o Heijblocq, can be more comforting to us?
